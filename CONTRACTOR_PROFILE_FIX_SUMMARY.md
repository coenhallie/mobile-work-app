# Contractor Profile Completion Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Database Schema Issues

- **Problem**: Missing `contractor_profiles` table with `user_id` column
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive database setup instructions in `DATABASE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- **Status**: Ready to execute SQL commands in Supabase

### 2. ✅ Storage Bucket Issues

- **Problem**: Missing storage buckets and RLS policies for file uploads
- **Solution**: Added bucket creation and policy setup in database instructions
- **Buckets**: `profile-images` and `work-photos` with proper RLS policies

### 3. ✅ Upload Function Issues

- **Problem**: Placeholder upload functions in CompleteProfileView.vue
- **Solution**: Implemented proper `uploadWorkPhoto()` and `updateUserProfileWithWorkPhotos()` functions
- **Features**:
  - Proper file path structure matching RLS policies
  - Error handling and validation
  - Public URL generation

### 4. ✅ Translation Keys

- **Problem**: Reported missing `completeProfile.skills` key
- **Status**: Key already exists in both `en-US.json` and `es-PE.json`
- **Verified**: All required translation keys are present

### 5. ✅ File Path Structure

- **Problem**: Profile picture upload path didn't match storage policies
- **Solution**: Updated file path from `avatars/${userId}-${timestamp}` to `${userId}/${timestamp}`
- **Result**: Now matches RLS policy expectations

### Immediate Action Required:

1. **Run Database Setup**: Execute the SQL commands from `DATABASE_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md` in your Supabase SQL Editor
