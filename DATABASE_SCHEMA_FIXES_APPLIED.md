  - ‚úÖ Public read access to all profile pictures and work photos
  - ‚úÖ Folder-based security using user ID in path

- **Supporting Tables:**

  - ‚úÖ `job_views` - Users can view their own job views, system can manage
  - ‚úÖ `user_notification_preferences` - Users can manage their own preferences

- **`onboarding_analytics`** ‚úÖ - A/B testing and analytics tracking
- **`job_views`** ‚úÖ - Engagement tracking for job browsing

## üìä Current Database State

### Contractor Profiles

- **Total profiles:** 51 (including demo data)
- **Completed onboarding:** 51 profiles
- **New columns ready:** `primary_skill`, `hourly_rate`, `work_photos` available for new data

### Storage Configuration

- **Profile pictures bucket:** ‚úÖ Configured and ready
- **Work photos bucket:** ‚úÖ Configured and ready
- **Public access:** ‚úÖ Both buckets allow public read access

### Security Status

- **RLS enabled:** ‚úÖ All tables have proper row-level security
- **Storage policies:** ‚úÖ Comprehensive upload/read policies in place
- **Access control:** ‚úÖ Users can only modify their own data

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Schema Compatibility

- Maintained existing `id` column as primary key for compatibility with demo data
- Added new columns without breaking existing functionality
- All existing contractor profiles remain functional

### Storage Security Model

- User-based folder structure: `{user_id}/filename.ext`
- Authenticated users can only access their own folders
- Public read access for displaying images in the app

### RLS Policy Structure

- Granular permissions for each operation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- User identity verification using `auth.uid()`
- Public access where appropriate for app functionality

## üöÄ Ready for Onboarding System

The database is now fully configured to support:

1. **Enhanced Profile Creation** - All required fields available
2. **File Upload System** - Profile pictures and work photos with proper security
3. **Gamification** - Credits system for onboarding engagement
4. **Analytics Tracking** - A/B testing and user behavior analysis
5. **Job Engagement** - View tracking for recommendation improvements

## üîç Verification Results

All schema changes have been tested and verified:

- ‚úÖ Contractor profiles table structure complete
- ‚úÖ Storage buckets properly configured
- ‚úÖ RLS policies working correctly
- ‚úÖ Supporting tables ready for onboarding system
- ‚úÖ Security advisors addressed (RLS enabled on all public tables)

The contractor profile completion flow should now work without database errors, and the optimized onboarding system can be fully implemented.
