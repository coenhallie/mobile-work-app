**Phase 1: Research & Analysis**

- **Step 1: Define the Problem & Market (Peru Focus)**

  - [ ] **Task:** Research & document the current process for finding/hiring handymen in Lima (and potentially Arequipa, Trujillo).
  - [ ] **Task:** Identify and list specific pain points for clients (trust issues, pricing ambiguity, availability, quality control). Use forums, social media (Peruvian groups), and potentially informal interviews.
  - [ ] **Task:** Identify and list specific pain points for handymen (finding consistent work, fair payment, marketing challenges).
  - [ ] **Task:** Gather data to estimate the potential market size (e.g., number of households in target cities, estimated frequency of repair/maintenance needs). Look for INEI (Peru's National Institute of Statistics and Informatics) data or market research reports.
  - [ ] **Task:** Identify and analyze direct competitors (other apps, websites) and indirect competitors (Facebook groups, WhatsApp referrals, traditional agencies) in Peru. Document their offerings, pricing, strengths, and weaknesses.
  - [ ] **Task:** Analyze popular Peruvian apps (Rappi, Yape, Plin, others beyond the obvious) for UI/UX patterns, onboarding flows, and features that resonate locally. Document key takeaways for user expectations.

- **Step 2: Define the Solution - The App**

  - [ ] **Task:** Clearly articulate the core value proposition for clients (e.g., "Fast, trusted, verified handymen on demand").
  - [ ] **Task:** Clearly articulate the core value proposition for handymen (e.g., "More jobs, fair pay, easy management").
  - [ ] **Task:** Detail the MVP features based on the requirements (User Roles, Signup, Service Browsing, Job Posting, contractor Search, Matching, Chat, Booking, Ratings, Payments). Keep it minimal but functional.
  - [ ] **Task:** Describe the intended user flow and experience, focusing on simplicity, speed, and trust (e.g., clear profiles, ratings visibility, secure chat). Create simple wireframes or flow diagrams if helpful (Mermaid could work here).
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[client Needs Service] --> B{Opens App};
        B --> C[Selects Service Category];
        C --> D[Posts Job Details (Desc, Photo, Time)];
        D --> E{App Notifies Relevant Handymen};
        F[contractor Views Job] --> G{Accepts/Applies};
        E --> H[client Reviews Applicants];
        H --> I[Selects & Books contractor];
        I --> J[In-App Chat for Details];
        J --> K[Service Completed];
        K --> L[Payment via App];
        L --> M[Mutual Rating/Review];
    end
    ```
  - [ ] **Task:** Outline the planned process for vetting and verifying handymen (e.g., ID check, background check considerations, skill verification ideas, initial interview).

- **Step 3: Analyze Technology Choices & Plan**

  - [ ] **Task:** Write justifications for choosing Tauri 2 (cross-platform efficiency, performance, security model), Vue 3 (reactivity, ecosystem, developer experience), and Tailwind/Shadcn (utility-first speed, consistency, component library).
  - [ ] **Task:** Outline a high-level system architecture diagram (e.g., Frontend <-> API <-> Database). Even if the backend is simple initially (maybe Tauri backend features or a separate lightweight API), sketch it out.
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[User (Vue 3 Frontend on Tauri)] --> B(Tauri Core / Potential Backend API);
        B --> C[Database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)];
        B --> D[Payment Gateway API];
        B --> E[Notification Service (Optional)];
    end
    ```
  - [ ] **Task:** List key technical challenges (real-time job updates, integrating Peruvian payment gateways, location-based filtering, ensuring Tauri cross-platform consistency, offline considerations if any).

- **Step 4: Analyze Monetization Strategies**

  - [ ] **Task:** Evaluate the initial "small connection fee for client" model. List pros (simple) and cons (price sensitivity in Peru, potential barrier to entry).
  - [ ] **Task:** Research and analyze alternative models:
    - Commission per job (%): Pros (scales with usage), Cons (contractor acceptance, calculation complexity).
    - contractor Subscription (Tiered): Pros (predictable revenue), Cons (value proposition for fee, contractor adoption).
    - Lead Generation Fee: Pros (pay-per-potential-job), Cons (tracking conversion, perceived fairness).
    - Freemium (client): Pros (user acquisition), Cons (conversion to paid, defining premium features).
  - [ ] **Task:** Recommend a primary strategy for launch (e.g., Commission %) and potentially a secondary one to explore later. Justify based on Peruvian market context, user willingness to pay, and simplicity for MVP.

- **Step 5: Plan Go-to-Market & Operations**

  - [ ] **Task:** Define a phased rollout plan (e.g., Start with Miraflores & San Isidro in Lima, then expand).
  - [ ] **Task:** Brainstorm and document initial user acquisition strategies for clients (e.g., targeted Facebook/Instagram ads, partnerships with building administrators, local flyers, referral bonuses).
  - [ ] **Task:** Brainstorm and document initial user acquisition strategies for handymen (e.g., outreach via existing online groups, partnerships with hardware stores/suppliers, simple referral program).
  - [ ] **Task:** Outline the contractor onboarding process (app training, profile setup support).
  - [ ] **Task:** Define a basic customer support plan for clients (e.g., in-app help section, email support initially).
  - [ ] **Task:** Outline basic operational procedures (how to handle disputes between users, payment failure process).

- **Step 6: Plan Payment Integration**

  - [ ] **Task:** Research popular and trusted Peruvian payment gateways suitable for marketplace apps (Culqi, Mercado Pago, PagoEfectivo are key). Investigate feasibility/complexity of direct Yape/Plin integration (often requires specific partnerships).
  - [ ] **Task:** Select 1-2 primary gateways for MVP integration.
  - [ ] **Task:** Document the integration plan, noting transaction fees and the process for handling payouts to handymen (frequency, method).

- **Step 7: Develop Basic Financial Projections**

  - [ ] **Task:** Estimate MVP development time (solo developer hours/weeks) and assign a cost (even if it's opportunity cost).
  - [ ] **Task:** Estimate monthly operational costs (cloud hosting/database, payment gateway minimums/fees, potential marketing spend).
  - [ ] **Task:** Create simple revenue projections for Year 1 & 2 based on the chosen monetization model and _conservative_ estimates for user adoption (number of jobs/month, number of subscribers, etc.).

- **Step 8: Assess Risks**
  - [ ] **Task:** Identify key risks: Low market adoption, strong competitor reaction, technical bugs, payment issues/fraud, difficulty acquiring _quality_ handymen, regulatory changes, safety/security incidents.
  - [ ] **Task:** For each key risk, propose 1-2 mitigation strategies (e.g., Risk: Low contractor quality -> Mitigation: Robust vetting, clear rating system, quick response to complaints).

**Phase 2: Document Creation**

- **Step 9: Draft the Business Case Document**

  - [ ] **Task:** Consolidate all the research and analysis from Steps 1-8 into a structured document. Use clear headings corresponding to the sections above.
  - [ ] **Task:** Write an Executive Summary condensing the key points (problem, solution, market, monetization, ask/goal).
  - [ ] **Task:** Create a high-level Execution Roadmap/Timeline diagram.
    ```mermaid
    gantt
        dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
        title       App Development Roadmap (High-Level)
        section Business Case
        Finalize Document      :a1, 2025-08-05, 1w

        Wider Rollout Prep     :a8, after a6, 4w
    end
    ```

- **Step 10: Review and Refine**
  - [ ] **Task:** Read through the entire document for clarity, consistency, and completeness.
  - [ ] **Task:** Ensure the arguments are logical and supported by the research (even if estimates are basic).
  - [ ] **Task:** Check for typos and grammatical errors.
