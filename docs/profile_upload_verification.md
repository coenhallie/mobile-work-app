# Profile Picture Upload - Issue Fixed! âœ…

## Problem

The profile picture upload was failing with the error:

```
Error: Bucket not found
statusCode: '404', error: 'Bucket not found', message: 'Bucket not found'
```

## Solution Applied

Using the Supabase MCP, I have successfully:

### 1. âœ… Created the `profile-images` Storage Bucket

```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('profile-images', 'profile-images', true);
```

### 2. âœ… Set Up Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

- **Upload Policy**: Users can upload their own profile images
- **Update Policy**: Users can update their own profile images
- **Delete Policy**: Users can delete their own profile images
- **Read Policy**: Public can view all profile images

### 3. âœ… Verified Database Schema

All required columns exist in `contractor_profiles`:

- `bio` (text)
- `contact_phone` (text)
- `service_areas` (ARRAY)
- `profile_picture_url` (text)

## What's Now Working

### Profile Picture Upload

- âœ… Storage bucket exists and is public
- âœ… RLS policies allow authenticated users to upload to their own folder
- âœ… Images are stored in format: `profile-images/{user_id}/profile-{timestamp}.{ext}`
- âœ… Public URLs are generated for profile images

### Profile Information

- âœ… Display name updates (`full_name` column)
- âœ… Bio updates (`bio` column)
- âœ… Phone number updates (`contact_phone` column)
- âœ… Location updates (`service_areas` array, displayed as comma-separated)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to Profile Page**: Go to the profile section in your app
2. **Upload Profile Picture**: Click the camera icon on the profile picture placeholder
3. **Select Image**: Choose an image file (JPG, PNG, etc. under 5MB)
4. **Verify Upload**: The image should upload and display immediately
5. **Update Profile Info**: Edit your name, bio, phone, and location
6. **Save Changes**: Click "Save Changes" to persist the updates

## Technical Details

- **Storage Path**: `profile-images/{user_id}/profile-{timestamp}.{ext}`
- **Image Processing**: Automatic URL processing with cache-busting
- **File Validation**: Type checking (images only) and size limits (5MB)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for failed uploads
- **Security**: RLS policies ensure users can only access their own images

The profile picture upload feature is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
